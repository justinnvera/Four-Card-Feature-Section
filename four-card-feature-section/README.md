### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS variables to cut down on texts of code and hassle.

```css
:root {
    --red: hsl(0, 78%, 62%);
    --cyan: hsl(180, 62%, 55%);
    --orange: hsl(34, 97%, 64%);
    --blue: hsl(212, 86%, 64%);
    --very-dark-blue: hsl(234, 12%, 34%);
    --grayish-blue: hsl(229, 6%, 66%);
    --very-light-gray: hsl(0, 0%, 98%);
}
```
### Continued development

I want to find more ways to cut down on code whether that's using utility classes or CSS variables.
